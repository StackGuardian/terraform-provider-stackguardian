# ONBOARDING EXAMPLE

- 1 single Business Organization
- 3 independent Web SaaS Projects with their dedicated resources: workers, tools and processes


## Software Project project-01
- Flat Hierarchical structure: there is no management so the team handles itself, and everyone
has full-stack profile so that everyone is working on frontend, backend and devops tasks.
    - 1 single role: developer
- They release fast and often, through staging and production environments and
may apply A/B testing on a set of selected features in production to validate them.
- The responsibility is incumbent upon everyone to verify that the cloud resources in any environment are
destroyed when not in use or not needed anymore for the next hours.
- They use StackGuardian for all their Automation tasks, from handling easily-resettable
development environments, short-lived testing and staging environments, and long term production
environment.


## Software Project project-02 (TBC)
- Typical Hierarchical structure: Two teams FE & BE, with one team manager & developers for each team.
Additionally one DevOps role is cross-functional and contributes to both teams.
- They release once every 2 weeks on Thursday, through staging and production environments.
- The responsibility is incumbent upon the DevOps role to verify that the cloud resources in any environment are
destroyed when not in use or not needed anymore for the next hours.
- They use StackGuardian for all their Automation tasks, from handling easily-resettable
development environments, short-lived testing and staging environments, and long term production
environment.


## Software Project project-03 (TBD)
- Smallest Team possible: one single developer with a full-stack profile working on frontend, backend and devops tasks.
- The developer needs access every resources but requires automation to clean cloud resources
