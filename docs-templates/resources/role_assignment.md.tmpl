# stackguardian_role_assignment (Resource)

## Example Usage

{{tffile "docs-examples/resources/role_assignment/resource.tf"}}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown }}


**Note:** The SSO provider name must match exactly with the SSO configuration in StackGuardian. While the API doesn't validate the provider name during resource creation, incorrect provider names will result in users having no permissions when they attempt to authenticate.

## Import

Import existing resource

### Using Import block (terraform v1.5.0 and later)
```terraform
import {
  to = stackguardian_role_assignment.example-role-assignment
  id = "user-id"
}
```

### Using CLI
```bash
terraform import stackguardian_connector.example-role-assignment user-id
```
