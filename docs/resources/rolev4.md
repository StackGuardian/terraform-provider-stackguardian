### Using Import block (terraform v1.5.0 and later)

}
```

```

## Migrating from stackguardian_role to stackguardian_rolev4

```terraform
// stackguardian_role example
resource "stackguardian_role" "test" {
  resource_name = "testing"
  allowed_permissions = {
    "PATCH/api/v1/orgs/lhind-master/wfgrps/<wfGrp>/wfs/<wf>/" = {
      name = "UpdateWorkflow"
      paths = {
        "<wfGrp>" = [
          "wfgrp1",
          "wfgrp2"
        ]
        "<wf>" = [
          "wf1",
          "wf2"
        ]
      }
    },
  }
}

// stackguardian_rolev4 equivalent example
resource "stackguardian_rolev4" "test" {
  resource_name = "testing"
  allowed_permissions = {
    "PATCH/api/v1/orgs/lhind-master/wfgrps/<wfGrp>/wfs/<wf>/" = {
      name = "UpdateWorkflow"
      paths = {
        "<wfGrp>" = [
          "wfgrp1|wfgrp2"
        ]
        "<wf>" = [
          "wf1|wf2"
        ]
      }
    },
  }
}
```

### Explanation

We can convert from role to rolev4 by combining all paths inside a list with a logical `|` operator.

Difference between `stackguardian_role` and `stackguardian_rolev4`

`stackguardian_role` resolves the resources by combining with each path with every other path. Resolving the paths from the above example:

- /wfGrp/wfgrp1/wf/wf1
- /wfGrp/wfgrp1/wf/wf2
- /wfGrp/wfgrp2/wf/wf1
- /wfGrp/wfgrp2/wf/wf2

</br>

`stackguardian_rolev4` resolves the resources by mapping paths one to one. Resolving paths from the above example:

- /wfGrp/wfgrp1/wf/wf1
- /wfGrp/wfgrp2/wf/wf2
